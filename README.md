Let's get this straight from the beginning: chances are that **you don't need this package**. It's aimed at the top 1% of the weirdest Atom users out there or, more likely, Atom developers. As the tagline suggests, it lets you run package commands to the built-in development console – who even does that? Nobody!

## Installation

Install `expose-commands` from Atom's [Package Manager](http://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/atom-packages/) or the command-line equivalent:

`$ apm install expose-commands`

### GitHub

Change to your Atom packages directory:

```bash
# Windows
$ cd %USERPROFILE%\.atom\packages

# Linux & macOS
$ cd ~/.atom/packages/
```

Clone the repository as `expose-commands`:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/idleberg/atom-expose-commands expose-commands
```

## Usage

Package commands are exposed to the console on activation. There are a few things to keep in mind before you can run these:

1. Commands are provided as `packageName.commandName` and always [camel cased](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Camel_case)
2. Commands are prefixed with `$`
3. Commands are asynchronous

**Examples:**

```js
// welcome:show
$welcome.show();

// set-syntax:CoffeeScript
$setSyntax.coffeeScript();

// set-syntax:SCSS
$setSyntax.scss();

// NSIS:show-version
$nsis.showVersion();
```

:warning: At this point only commands with alphanumeric characters and dashes are supported
